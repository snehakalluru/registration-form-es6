# Registration Form Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates building a user registration form in two phases:
- **Phase 1:** Implemented using JavaScript function prototypes.
- **Phase 2:** Refactored using ES6 classes and objects for modern, maintainable code.

The form validates user input, displays feedback, and persists data using localStorage. It also includes search and delete functionality to manage registered users.

## Features
- **Form Validation**
  - Name must be at least 2 characters
  - Email must be at least 5 characters (basic validation)
  - Aadhaar must be 12 digits
  - Gender selection required
- **Feedback Messages**
  - Success and error alerts using Bootstrap
- **Data Persistence**
  - Registered users are saved in localStorage
  - Data reloads automatically on page refresh
- **Search Functionality**
  - Filter table rows by name, email, Aadhaar, or gender
- **Delete Functionality**
  - Remove entries from both the table and localStorage

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript (Function Prototypes & ES6 Classes)
- LocalStorage API
